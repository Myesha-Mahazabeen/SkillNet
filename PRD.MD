## ðŸ‘€ Problem

SkillNet addresses the common challenges people face when trying to learn new skills or hobbies. Many individuals struggle to access affordable and personalized learning opportunities in their local communities. This problem is particularly prevalent among lifelong learners, hobbyists, and individuals seeking cost-effective ways to acquire new skills. The lack of accessible learning resources often leads to frustration and limits personal development opportunities.

Through research and feedback from potential users, we have identified the urgent need for a platform that facilitates skill exchange and fosters a collaborative learning environment. People want a solution that allows them to easily connect with others in their community to share expertise and acquire new skills. Solving this problem is important because it empowers individuals to grow and develop through shared knowledge and experiences, leading to personal enrichment and skill enhancement.

## ðŸ’­ Proposal

SkillNet proposes to create a platform that simplifies the process of learning and teaching new skills by connecting individuals within their local communities. Our solution involves the following key features:

- **User Profiles**: Users can create profiles and list the skills they want to learn and the skills they can teach.
- **Skill Swapping Algorithm**: An algorithm suggests potential skill swaps based on user preferences, location, and availability.
- **Communication and Scheduling**: Users can communicate and schedule skill exchange sessions within the platform using in-app messaging.
- **Endorsements and Ratings**: Users can build credibility by receiving endorsements for skills taught or learned, similar to LinkedIn. Additionally, users can rate and provide feedback on skill exchange experiences to maintain a high-quality community.
- **Events and Workshops**: Users can host or join skill-sharing events, workshops, or meetups in their local area.

This solution provides a user-friendly and cost-effective platform for individuals of all proficiency levels and backgrounds to learn and share skills within their community. It promotes collaborative learning and enables users to personalize their learning experiences based on their interests and goals.
